    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",

    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",

    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "### Decision Trees\n",
    "  - It can be applied to medical diagnosis to test whether a person is suffering from a particular disease or not.[https://www.quora.com/In-what-real-world-applications-is-the-decision-tree-classifier-used]\n",
    "  - it's main strength is that it can perform on continous inputs as well as categorical inputs also.The algorithm is simple to understand, interpret and visualize as the idea is mostly used in our daily lives.[https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_are_pros_and_cons_of_decision_tree_versus_other_classifier_as_KNN_SVM_NN]\n",
    "  - The high classification error rate while training set is small in comparison with the number of classes. Exponential calculation growth while problem is getting bigger.[https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_are_pros_and_cons_of_decision_tree_versus_other_classifier_as_KNN_SVM_NN]\n",
    "  - as the training set of this problem consist of 80% of the dataset then the classification error will be reduced due to large number of data in the training set in comparison with the number of classes and as the dataset originally consist of categorial features so there will be no need of converting categorical features to numeric continous features because decision tree algorithm performs well on categorical features too. \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Ensembles method(AdaBoost)\n",
    "   - This model can be used in Face Detection.[https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/05/boosting-algorithms-simplified/]\n",
    "   - This model combines several weak learners to give a single strong learner.It performs well on large training set.\n",
    "   - This model is very prone  to overfitting when the training set is small.\n",
    "   - The training set of census dataset consist of 80% of the entire datatset whch makes training set large enough to perform adaboost algorithmn and this model is good as the problem is focused toward precision.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Support Vector Machines(SVM)\n",
    "   - SVM is used in medical diagnosis to predict whether a person is suffering from a particular disease or not given its basic details such as age,bmi,skin-thickness etc.[https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6947-10-16]\n",
    "   - easy to visualise classification boundary.Works well with even unstructured and semi structured data like text, Images and trees.The kernel trick is real strength of SVM. With an appropriate kernel function, we can solve any complex problem.[https://statinfer.com/204-6-8-svm-advantages-disadvantages-applications/]\n",
    "   - Choosing a “good” kernel function is not easy.Long training time for large datasets.\n",
    "   - As SVM not only separates the data but also maintains a good margin between the separation so it will be good to try this model as it will help in easy predcition."

    "By looking at the performance metrics graph above it is confirm that SVC clasiffier will be rejected because it takes large training and testing time for large datatset.For 100% of the training set SVC almost takes 100 seconds for training and testing which is not accepted.\n",

    "Now from the rest two(DecisionTreeClassifier,AdaBoostclassifier), the best model for charityML for predicting donors will be AdaBoost.Though DecisionTree and AdaBoost gives almost same training and testing time,adaboost performs well on large dataset.By looking at the training accuracy-score and training fbeta_score, DecisionTree performs well on each sample size than AdaBoost but it gives less performance in testing acuuracy_score and f_score than AdaBoost.This shows that DecisionTree tries to memorize the training dataset instead of learning it so it  is prone to overfitting and as a result it will not generalize well.AdaBoost shows nominal performance in both training and testing so it will not overfit and underfit the training data.As this problem is more focused towards PRECISION so the model which will give best f_score for 100% training sample will be best .AdaBoost gives more f_score for 100% training data in testing than DecisionTree so it is concluded that AdaBoost Is the best model out of the three model choosen. \n"

    "For this problem,the best model for predicting donors will be ensemble model in particular AdaBoost model.This model performs well on large dataset and as this problem contains 36177 data points in training set so the AdaBoost model will do good here.This model develops several weak learners which gives different independent predictions and wil combines all these weak learners to give a single strong learner.It uses boosting methods for combining weak learners.In boosting method following steps are taken :\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1:  The weak learner takes all the data points and assign equal weight or attention to each observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: If there is any prediction error caused by first weak learning algorithm, then we pay higher attention to observations having prediction error and gives high weight to the miss-classified points. Then, we apply the next weak learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Iterate Step 2 till the limit of weak learning algorithm is reached or higher accuracy is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it combines the outputs from weak learner and creates  a strong learner which eventually improves the prediction power of the model. Boosting pays higher focus on examples which are mis-classiﬁed or have higher errors by preceding weak rules.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn.
